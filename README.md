# PoEAnalyzer
Playing with the public POE APIs

For now it:
* Displays the current tabs
* Value my stash (essences, cards, scarabs, divinations and currency)

I'll play with the public POE APIs to:

* Get current divination cards that are being sold for less than their results
* Upload this to Azure
* Use azure web functions? why not...
  * Get stash tab contents
  * PriceCurrency
  * GetDivinationCardItem
  * GetDivinationsToBuy
* Add redis to cache all!
